# HelpAfghanRefugees

Front-End Web Design and Development Final Project

The U.S. military exit from Afghanistan may be the end of the war, but it's just the beginning of needed services to help Afghan refugees who were able to escape the country. Instability in Afghanistan is putting the lives of millions of children and families at risk. Flaring conflict has pushed the nation's child casualty rates to record heights: since the start of the year, 550 Afghan children have been killed and 1,400 injured. Half the population (more than 18 million people, including nearly 10 million children) need humanitarian assistance.

The goal of this project design and build a website to raise awareness about this issue and provide sources of information and place where people can access to donate to help Afghan refugees.
