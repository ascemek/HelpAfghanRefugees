				<h3>Become A Volunteer</h3>
				<p>
					Providing housing for newly-arrived Afghan families is currently the biggest need, but there are many different volunteer opportunities. If you are able to provide temporary or permanent housing or would like to support Afghan families in your community in another way please contact us. We have 24 community affiliates around the U.S., many of which have specific pages dedicated to their Afghanistan-related volunteer opportunities. You can also reach out to other local refugee agencies to sign up. We are partnering with Airbnb to connect displaced people in need of temporary housing (including refugees from Afghanistan) with community members who have available space to share. Afghans who are arriving in the U.S. will be coming to the Washington, D.C., area; Houston and Fort Worth, Texas; and Seattle and Tacoma, Wash. Here's how you can help them and organizations on the ground in Afghanistan. Volunteer to help resettled refugees: A lot of organizations are asking for volunteers to help refugees upon arrival with airport pickups, meal assistance, mentorship, tutoring and more. You can participate if you're in one of the areas where refugees are arriving, and there's a standby list to join for other areas too. You can also donate. Take up a challenge: Women for Women International says a "generous member of our community" will match up to $500,000 in donations for its Afghanistan program.
